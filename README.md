# CelebrateWithHedera: The Ultimate Way to Make Every Occasion Special

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
Have you ever found yourself grappling with the challenge of picking the perfect gifts for your friends during festive seasons like Diwali and Christmas? Sometimes, it feels like your creative thinking hits a roadblock. And if you've ever chosen a gift that didn't quite hit the mark, well, you're not alone in that experience. If you've been in this situation, know that we share your dilemma.

We're working on resolving this issue within the Hedera Ecosystem, where currently, there isn't a platform for sending Hedera Tokens with greetings. That's why we've developed an innovative platform that enables you to convey your heartfelt wishes alongside digital tokens on those special occasions. This transforms your gifts into lasting memories for your beloved friends, family, and colleagues.


## âš™ What it does
Are you ready to elevate your celebrations to the next level? With CelebrateWithHedera, you can do just that! We've created a revolutionary platform that allows you to send your warm wishes along with digital tokens on those special occasions, transforming your gifts into unforgettable memories for your cherished friends, family, and colleagues.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
For building Frontend we use Next.js and TailwindCSS for animation. For storing data we use  Hedera protocol. For writing Smart Contact we use Solidity. 

## Most Creative Use of Github 
Our project, CelebrateWithHedera, perfectly aligns with the "Most Creative Use of GitHub" track, as it showcases innovative collaboration and development. Our team of three members collaborated seamlessly on various aspects of the code during the hackathon. Together, we created a unique platform that allows users to send HBAR along with heartfelt greeting messages and much more. Our creative use of GitHub played a pivotal role in enabling this collaborative effort, allowing us to efficiently manage, version control, and merge our code contributions. This platform is a testament to the power of creative collaboration facilitated by GitHub, demonstrating the true spirit of the "Most Creative Use of GitHub" track.

## ðŸ’ªChallenges we ran into
- It is our first time building a complete Dapp on Hedera Blockchain as well as working with Solidity and Smart Contract writing at first we are unable to understand the working on the same and fix some issues regarding deployment of the Smart COntract. But we are able to do it after reading documentation or searching more about it.

- Thinking about the project as per the perspective of startup is initially hard for us, but after talking to real user we will be able to do that.

It was hard to make a fully responsive and beautiful UI of CelebrateWithHedera. But we are able to do it because of teamwork.
